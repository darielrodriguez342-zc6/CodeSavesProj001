# CodeSavesProj001
My name is Dariel and I am currently taking software development 1, CEN-3024C-14877 
My boxing application from my prior coding class.
The goal of the application is to use generic containers to hold various objects such as:
boxers, boxing gyms and local boxing tournaments. All based off of the show hajime no ippo.
This Application was submitted to Object Oriented Programming COP-3330C-31776 for the module 6 project.
